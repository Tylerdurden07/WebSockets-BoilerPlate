# WebSockets-BoilerPlate
simple boiler plate to try out a chat application with socket io in nodejs

Do a npm install from the project directory to resolve the dependencies

Execute nodemon app.js and open browser, hit localhost://8080 to see the chat ui


# Uncomment the implementation code to have the socket io event callbacks bindings
# To have the Chat working :)
